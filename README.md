## 🚀 Key Features

### 🆘 Emergency SOS Response
- **One-Tap SOS**: Long-press activation to prevent accidental triggers.
- **Smart Alerting**: Automatically notifies the 3 nearest police stations and emergency contacts.
- **Live Tracking**: Shares real-time GPS location with responders and trusted contacts.
- **Face Recognition**: Integrated AI-powered face recognition to identify individuals in emergency recordings.

### 📝 Incident Reporting
- **Multimedia Reports**: Attach photos and videos as evidence for incidents.
- **Anonymous Mode**: Report safety concerns without revealing your identity.
- **Community-Driven**: Upvote/downvote reports to help verify the legitimacy of incidents.
- **Geospatial Intelligence**: Reports are plotted on a live map for community awareness.

### 📊 Safety Analytics
- **Crime Heatmaps**: Visualizes high-risk areas based on historical incident data.
- **Route Safety Checker**: Analyze your planned travel route and receive safety recommendations.
- **Localized Statistics**: Detailed crime trends and safety scores for specific areas.

### 🧠 Digital Gut Feeling (AI Subconscious Detection)
- **Subconscious Risk Detection**: Uses mobile sensors (Accelerometer/Gyroscope) to detect subconscious signs of fear (micro-tremors, hesitation, agitation).
- **Proactive Alerts**: Automatically prompts "Are you safe?" if high-stress movement patterns are detected.
- **Privacy-First**: Analysis happens locally or on a private server; raw sensor data is never stored permanently.

### 🔒 Privacy & Security
- **OTP Verification**: Secure login via phone and email OTP.
- **App Security**: PIN-based local protection for sensitive safety data.
- **Encrypted Data**: National ID (NID) and personal data are stored using industry-standard encryption.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20+)
- MongoDB (Local or Atlas)
- Expo Go app on your physical device (for testing)

### 1. Setup Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
# Create .env file based on .env.example
npm run seed  # Feed initial police station data
npm run dev   # Start development server
```

### 2. Setup AI Server (Optional - for Gut Feeling)
```bash
cd ai-research
# Setup Python Environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Download Data & Train (First time only)
./download_data.sh
python train_model.py
# Start Server
python server.py
```

### 3. Setup Mobile App
```bash
cd mobile-expo
npm install
npm start
```
